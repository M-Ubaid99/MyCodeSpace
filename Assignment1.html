    <p>
        I am Writing to apply for the position of sales Assistant at ABC Clothing Ltd, which was advertised on Trade Me
        on 14 February 2013.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have enclosed my CV to support my application. It shows that i would bring important skills to the position,
        including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            time management and strong organisational skills
        </li>
        <li>
            high-level customer service and friendly relationship management
        </li>
        <li>
            cash handling and sales ability
        </li>
        <li>
            motivation and dedication
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As a Sales Assistant at a busy shoe store, I have been able to build up a strong foundation of customer service
        skills. Though I have really enjoyed this role, I am looking for a new challenge in my career. The Sales
        Assistant role with ABC Clothing Ltd would offer me a chance to grow and further develop my retail career.
    </p>
    <p>
        I would enjoy having the opportunity to talk with you more about this position, and how I could use my skills to
        benefit your organisation at an interview.
